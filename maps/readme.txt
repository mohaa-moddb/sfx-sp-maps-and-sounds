Serverside Sound Fix by SorridStroker

SP Map conversions by Cobra {sfx}

NOTE ...

Sorrids soundfix uses statefiles - if you have mods on your server that use any statefile changes
then you will need to combine the 2 to make 1, or not use this fix if you dont know what your doing.


I added these maps to Sorrids SP sound fix so peeps only need one PK3, You do NOT need any other sound fixes.


If you are having problems with this pk3 on your server then i suggest you remove this PK3 
and use Clientside sound fixes.

I am releasing the SP conversions in 2 formats


This one which is included with Sorrids serverside fix set up ready for you


A none-Sorrid-soundfix-supported-version (just incase you have problems with the combination).


Have fun :)
